## Description

The **EnrollMate** application is a comprehensive platform that allows users to view, add, update, and delete student information. It was developed using **Angular 17** for the front-end and is designed to be scalable and easy to extend with more features in the future.

Key features of this app include:
- A responsive user interface to view student details.
- Ability to add new student records.
- Edit and update existing student information.
- Delete student records when necessary.
- Communicates with a backend server to handle student data CRUD operations.

## Technologies Used

This application utilizes the following technologies and packages:

- **Angular 17**: The primary front-end framework used to build the application.
- **Angular CLI 17.0.5**: Command-line interface for Angular used for creating and managing the Angular project.
- **Bootstrap**: For responsive and mobile-first design.
- **Angular Router**: For navigation and routing between views.
- **HttpClientModule**: For making HTTP requests to the backend API.
- **RxJS**: For handling asynchronous operations and managing data streams.
- **Karma**: For unit testing the Angular components.
- **Jasmine**: For writing unit tests in Angular.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.
